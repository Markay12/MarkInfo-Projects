## Welcome!

My name is Mark Ashinhust and I am a Computer Systems Engineering student at Arizona State University with a minor in Computational Mathematics. I am in my final year of my undergraduate degree, looking to graduate in four.

Here you will find a portfolio with many of the projects that I have worked on in my time at ASU and where my love for computers and engineering began. At many places on this site you can find my email [ashinhust.brass@gmail.com]. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

## About Me

I have lived in Surprise and Tempe Arizona all my life. I am currently 21 years old. I did not have many plans going into college when I was in High School. I knew that I wanted to but didn't have much preference on where I was going to go.

The two main things I was focused on during my time before college were computers and music. Music is a large part of my life and has been a way for me to relax and became something that I really enjoy. I have played the piano for almost 12-13 years and trumpet for 7. At the same time, I was interested in computers and began taking classes at school. Then comes my senior year of high school where I had to make a tough decision on what I wanted to pursue as a career. I decided to choose Computer Systems Engineering and have never looked back.

I am now working at Discover Financial Services as a Unix Engineering Intern for the summer of 2022 in Riverwoods, IL. Once I have completed my degree and have a chance to move down new paths into a career I would like to branch out and see the world. I want to help the world in any way that I can while doing something that I love. Seeing the world has been a passion of mine for a while and I believe that as long as I keep trying and working hard I can find a way.

## About my Projects

A lot of these projects will be designed around material that I have learned throughout my time at ASU. Therefore, some of the material cannot be step-by-step for privacy and copyright purposes. Please email me if there is something you would like more information on.

Some of these projects will provide a step-by-step guide on how to complete it, along with pictures on how I did myself! A few have videos that I upload onto my youtube channel as a demo and the rest will provide pictures and information.

Enjoy!
