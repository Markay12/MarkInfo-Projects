## Welcome!

My name is Mark Ashinhust and I am a Computer Systems Engineer. I was born in Surprise, Arizona in 2001 and completed my bachelors degree in Computer Systems Engineering degree at Arizona State University. 

Here you will find a portfolio with many of the projects that I have worked on in my time at ASU and where my love for computers and engineering began. At many places on this site you can find my email [ashinhust.brass@gmail.com]. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

## About Me

I have lived in Surprise and Tempe Arizona all my life. I am currently 21 years old. I did not have many plans going into college when I was in High School. I knew that I wanted to attend but didn't have much preference on where I was going to go.

The two main things I was focused on during my time before college were computers and music. Music is a large part of my life and has been a way for me to relax and became something that I really enjoy. I have played the piano for almost 12-13 years and trumpet for 7. At the same time, I was interested in computers and began taking classes at school. Then comes my senior year of high school where I had to make a tough decision on what I wanted to pursue as a career. I decided to choose Computer Systems Engineering and have never looked back.

I am now working at Discover Financial Services as a Unix Engineering Intern for the summer of 2022 in Riverwoods, IL. Once I have completed my degree and have a chance to move down new paths into a career I would like to branch out and see the world. I want to help the world in any way that I can while doing something that I love. Seeing the world has been a passion of mine for a while and I believe that as long as I keep trying and working hard I can find a way.

[Update]

As of December 2022, I have accepted a full time job that will begin in June of 2023 after I complete my degree. I will begin working with Garmin International with their Flight Management Systems team. This job includes route navigation (flight planning, calculation of a 3D trajectory through the airspace, modeling the performance characteristics of the aircraft to determine the speed and climb capability so that we can predict time of arrival and fuel consumption, takeoff and landing distance and airspeeds, AEO (All Engine's Operating) and OEI (One Engine Inop) climb performance etc.).

[Update 2] 
I have completed my degree at Arizona State University and have now begun working at Garmin International as a software engineer. I am a software engineer 1 working in Chandler, Arizona. A description of my job can be found in the above paragraph. As I continue to work on personal projects, they will be updated here. Along with the book reviews and information I gather, I hope to continue to update this site.

## About my Projects

A lot of these projects will be designed around material that I have learned throughout my time at ASU. Therefore, some of the material cannot be step-by-step for privacy and copyright purposes. Please email me if there is something you would like more information on.

Some of these projects will provide a step-by-step guide on how to complete it, along with pictures on how I did myself! A few have videos that I upload onto my youtube channel as a demo and the rest will provide pictures and information.

Enjoy!
