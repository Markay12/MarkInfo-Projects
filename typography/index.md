Hello! My name is Mark Ashinhust and I am a student at Arizona State University.  
I am currently in the second semester of my sophomore year studying Computer Systems Engineering and Computational Mathematics.

I have a strong passion for technology and programming and have always wanted to follow something down this path. Now that I have finally made the jump into a secondary education, I am learning all of the subcategories within this career. These projects represent my branching into many of these categories and learning what I can do as a computer engineer. I have also completed multiple circuits classes which have brought great interest to me as well.

Other than programming, I love to go to the gym and spend time with my family. Since beginning College, I have found the gym to be my favorite escape and break from school. This keeps my both my mental and physical health to the fullest. When I am not programming or at the gym, I love to spend time with my family. My mother, father and dog are and always will be my best friends and I always look forward to the time that I can spend with them. 

I have always strived to become a better person and these are the people that have brought me to where I am today and I couldn't be more thankful. Enjoy!
