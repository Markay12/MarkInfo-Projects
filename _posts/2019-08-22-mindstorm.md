## What is the Mindstorms EV3 Robot Project?

* This project involves the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot with the mission of completing navigation through a maze autonomously. Additionally, this robot was required to stop when sensing certain colors on the ground (stop sign) and had to successfully pick up a *passenger* and bring them to the ending destination. 

* The robot did not know where it was starting and did not know where the end location was until placed in the maze at time of demonstration.

* Our robot was able to successfully complete the task at hand stopping at all stop signs and bringing our passenger to its final destination

### *_Demonstration Day_*
---

The main rules of the course were a little difficult in the final go of the robot, however, we were able to successfully get the robot through the course having a drop off and pick up point. Our robot did not work in a fully autonomous style, however, it did go through at least 1/3 of the course in an autonomous style. Videos and pictures will be updated soon.

* scored a 97/100
* 1st place in the robot battles
