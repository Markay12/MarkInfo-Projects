According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, "sleep patterns change as you age", and "varies significantly across individuals of the same age". Keeping this in mind, it is interesting to understand what times many people at ASU, whether students or faculty, go to bed at night.
Though these statistics and findings don't incorporate what time people are waking up, it is interesting to note what time they are 'attempting' to fall alseep.

# Statistical Analysis Method

---

The method used to gather data for this analysis was conducted with google forms. A total of 155 responses were gathered, however, only 153 of those responses were used.

Google forms provided a good platform to conduct this analysis and allowed for the most amount of responses. Responses were gathered from the r/ASU subreddit, multiple Discord servers and personal friends.

# Purpose

---

The purpose of this analysis is to understand what time ASU affiliates attempt to go to bed at night. Since this was a public survey and did not collect any personal information it is unclear whether all people that responded were affiliated with ASU. Therefore, that part of the statistic should be taken lightly.

Looking at this data, one can clearly understand what times (of the 153) generally go to bed.

# Types of Data

---

The data from this survey was analsyzed into different methods.

1. Population Analysis
2. Point Sample Analysis

The first analysis conducted is based off the total of the 153 respondents. The average bedtime, variance and standard deviation were all calculated and documented in the notebook.

The second form of analysis was taken with 30 point samples, each consisting of 5 respondents. From this, 30 sample means were calculated to represent what average times these groups were going to sleep at night.
