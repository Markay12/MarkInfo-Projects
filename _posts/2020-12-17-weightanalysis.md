Personally, I am someone who is very invested in my personal health. Therefore, I spend a lot of the time in the gym focusing on the balance between my work life and physical life.  
With all of this I also actively watch what I eat and where I weigh in on the days that I go to the gym. Though I manually record all of my weight, I figured it was a good time to apply this to something I was learning.  
_  
Therefore, the data represented here is my weight from the middle of November 2020 to the end of December 2020. This was really just an attempt to understand new libraries (**NumPy, Panda, Matplotlib**) as well as data regression analysis.  
_  
The graphs here represent my weights and as I approach a new bulk I hope to see visual increases along with some nice mathematical proofs.  
_  
Access to the graphs and charts can be found below.
