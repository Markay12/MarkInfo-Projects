Personally, I am someone who is very invested in my personal health. Therefore, I spend a lot of the time in the gym focusing on the balance between my work life and physical life.  
With all of this I also actively watch what I eat and where I weigh in on the days that I go to the gym. Though I manually record all of my weight, I figured it was a good time to apply this to something I was learning. 

Therefore, the data represented here is my weight from the middle of November 2020 to the end of December 2020. This was really just an attempt to understand new libraries (**NumPy, Panda, Matplotlib**) as well as data regression analysis. 

The graphs here represent my weights and as I approach a new bulk I hope to see visual increases along with some nice mathematical proofs.

Access to the graphs and charts can be found below. Feel free to contact me for any information.
