excerpt: "As of April 13th 2021 the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine administration was paused to the public in the United States. This was then resumed on the 23rd. In this post I try to explain and understand how many 'missed' doses could have been given out during this time. Furthermore, what were the complications of not having these doses administered to the general public?"

Hypothesis: The temporary halt in distribution of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine led to more hospitalizations and deaths compared to the amount of people who had vaccine complications.  

* The complications mentioned are those that led to the pause of the vaccine distribution. These complications are elaborated on further in the document.  

This issue has similar notes as the problem with short-term climate change effects. Most citizens are more worried about smaller short-term complications rather than the larger issue that continues to grow.
