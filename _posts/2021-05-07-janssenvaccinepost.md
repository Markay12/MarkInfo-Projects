excerpt: "As of April 13th 2021 the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine administration was paused to the public in the United States. This was then resumed on the 23rd. In this post I try to explain and understand how many 'missed' doses could have been given out during this time. Furthermore, what were the complications of not having these doses administered to the general public?"
