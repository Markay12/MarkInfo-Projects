# Swift Language

Swift is an intuitive programming language created by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. It's an open-source language that is designed to be not only easy to learn, but also powerful enough for professional developers. Since its introduction in 2014, Swift has quickly become one of the fastest growing languages in history.

Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. The compiler is optimized for performance, and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either.

Swift incorporates the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience building Apple platforms. Named parameters are expressed in a clean syntax that makes APIs in Swift even more easy to read and maintain. Memory is managed automatically and there is no use of semicolons.

In addition, Swift supports inferred types to make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes, and modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces.
