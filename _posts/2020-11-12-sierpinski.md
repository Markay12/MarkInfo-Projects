## What is Sierpinski's Carpet?

This 'carpet' is called a fractal design and was implemented into C++ via my algorithm. A fractal design is a self-similar subset of Euclidean space whose fractal dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension. The most notable of these can be found with the Mandelbrot set.




In this demonstration we used the Sierpinski Carpet which is a derivative of many of his findings and projects. This carpet represents radio antennae and its uniqueness. The fractal design is one generalization of the Cantor set to two dimension.




Understanding the math behind this is definitely something to look at more and study, but just looking at it will suffice.
