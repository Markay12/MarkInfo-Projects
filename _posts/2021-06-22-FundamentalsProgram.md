Over the past few years I have had a lot of time to spend gathering information on going to the gym and working on some new exercise routines. Over this time I have gained a lot of knowledge and have decided to share this with my friends and anyone who wishes to learn too!  

This program is broken into a few different parts in regards to weight training, warming up, stretching, priming, lifting plans and lastly diet and nutrition.  

All of these are futile in understanding and learning to grow at the gym. There is great saying that says "You can't outwork a bad diet" and this is one of the reasons that I have made sure to add in a whole small guide to beginning of nutrition.  

## Part 1 - Welcome
The first part of this document begins with an introduction and explains who this program is aimed for (anyone and everyone).  
I begin with some common misconceptions that happen within the lifting world as well as what you may have heard on television or in magazines.  
There is a lot of information that gets spread around the world that gives a false sense of what working out and training your body really means. Here I try and decifer these misguidings and get you onto the best path to growth and success.  

## Part 2 - Warming Up  
Warming up is one of the most common things that people neglect to do before starting a weight training program. Though it may not be apparent when you are first starting out, this is something that will keep you active and strong at the gym.  

In this section of the guide I demonstrate some good warmups that you should do before each type of exercise. Which ones you should consider before working on legs and which to consider before working on chest. Additionally, there are a few stretching/warmups that are not good for certain types of exercise. A lot of people stretch with what are called static exercises rather than active. This type would not be best suited if you are about to go do some resistance training.   
Examples like this are explained within the document below.  

## Part 3 - Equipment  
No!! YOU DON'T NEED A GYM MEMBERSHIP!  

In this section I discuss what equipment you can use both at the gym and at home. There are many ways to do resistance training and not all of it must come from going to the gym. There are a lot of bodyweight and strong exercises that you can do at home and with resistance bands.  

Whether you don't want to use equipment because of issues with access, time, money or ability. There is definitely something in this program for you!  

## Part 4 - Training Programs  
This section of the guide completely focuses on the different kinds of training programs you can work through. Working out for just 15 minutes per day can easily give you so much ability to grow and benefit your health. I would consider taking this time to workout a schedule where you can figure out what best works for you!   
I include 4 different workout plans with one being completely intended for those who want to workout at home or at the gym with no equipment. There are a few things you may need to use around the house such as a chair but nothing out of the ordinary.  

The other three programs work at the gym but can be changed if you choose not to use the gym or don't have access to all the equipment.  
The first plan is a 3-day per week full body workout which is a pretty good start for those who don't have a lot of time to go to the gym but want to get a lot of things done.   
The second plan
