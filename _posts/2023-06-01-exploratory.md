# Exploratory

## About

Exploratory is an app developed solely by myself (Mark Ashinhust). This app has been coded using the Swift 5 programming language and XCode on my 2021 Macbook Pro M1.

### Swift 5 

Swift 5 is a major iteration of the Swift programming language developed by Apple for iOS development. Released in 2019, Swift 5 introduced stable application binary interface (ABI) across Apple platforms. This further introduces easily creatable and maintained binary frameworks. 

Swift 5 brought about significant enhancements. 

1. New Standard Library
2. New Language Features
3. Improvements in string handling
4. Performance

The language supports memory safety and has syntactic sugar to make code easily readable and writable.

## Progress
