Discipline Is Destiny was random book pickup for me while at Target this winter. I saw they had a great deal on three books for only $15 in Arizona. One of the three books that I picked up was this one. It seemed like something that I would normally read and peaked my interest. As it turns out this was a great book to read and really kicked me out of some bad habits and bad frame of mind. Too little do we take for granted things in our life without realization.

The first thing that Ryan brings up before entering the first chapter is the difference between _vice_ or _virtue_. I have found it important to realize which is which in daily life and to choose the virtues. Not all of life is so easy and sometimes it is too simple to take the easy choice. It is hard to see how something is going to benefit you when that is 5 years away, but that is what is going to be best for you and we need to realize when to make those choices and how.

Now that the first introduction into the main theme of the book has been made, I want to introduce the strongest points of the book to me. I will be going through the chapters and talking points and describing what really spoke to me and what I am now thinking about in my daily life. By using some of these methods in your daily life, you may see great improvements in all aspects of your mental and physical health.
