Discipline Is Destiny was random book pickup for me while at Target this winter. I saw they had a great deal on three books for only $15 in Arizona. One of the three books that I picked up was this one. It seemed like something that I would normally read and peaked my interest. As it turns out this was a great book to read and really kicked me out of some bad habits and bad frame of mind. Too little do we take for granted things in our life without realization.

The first thing that Ryan brings up before entering the first chapter is the difference between _vice_ or _virtue_. I have found it important to realize which is which in daily life and to choose the virtues. Not all of life is so easy and sometimes it is too simple to take the easy choice. It is hard to see how something is going to benefit you when that is 5 years away, but that is what is going to be best for you and we need to realize when to make those choices and how.

Now that the first introduction into the main theme of the book has been made, I want to introduce the strongest points of the book to me. I will be going through the chapters and talking points and describing what really spoke to me and what I am now thinking about in my daily life. By using some of these methods in your daily life, you may see great improvements in all aspects of your mental and physical health.

## Chapter 1

The chapters in this book are spread out and don't follow the typical chapters you may be used to. Ryan splits the book into chapters but has many short excerpts located within each chapter.

The first chapters are centered around the exterior (your body). The first story is one that really resonated with me and dealt with the baseball player Lou Gherig. He was known for the most consecutive baseball games in history until Cal Ripken Junior. This is the first person that attributes the feeling of discipline. Lou was such a strong player and even stronger mentally. He was able to hold himself accountable for his actions and stop himself when he knew he was about to do something that he should not.

This is something that we should all do in our daily lives. We should be accountable for our own actions and know how they are going to influence the rest of our lives. He had great guidance and even stronger discipline.

This chapter taught me many things which I will summarize below:

-   Always giving yourself what you want will never satisfy you. Sometimes you need to take a step back and tell yourself no. There will be another chance but just putting that second cupcake down will make the next one so much sweeter.

-   This funnels into addictions and what Ryan titled as "Don't be a Slave". When reading this chapter all I could think about was being a slave to so many things in the world around us. Many people become slaves to drugs. Control your mind and your body will follow. It is so important to control yourself and not let it go.

-   Distractions are too common in the world today and all around us. A good way to see this is by taking a good look at your desk at home or work. When I took a look at my desk at work and at home, I noticed so many things around me that could distract me or take away valuable work space. It is best to have a clear desk to do your work and get it done to the best of your ability.

-   Show up to your life and the things that are going on around you. As quoted from the book, show up...

1. When you're tired
2. When you don't have to
3. even if you have an excuse
4. even if you are busy
5. even if you won't get recognized for it.

-   This next two parts of the book took me a second to think about because they were contradictory. However, I believe that if you use both of these correctly, they can be a great addition to your life.
