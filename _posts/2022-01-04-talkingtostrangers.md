## First Reactions

Malcolm Gladwell is a great author and has slowly become my favorite throughout the past few years. From novels like What the Dog Saw, David and Goliath and Outliers he always has something interesting to say and captivates my interests. While reading through his Afterword in this novel and hearing his story I learned a bit more about him and something fascinating to me is the amount of effort that he puts into his work. When writing this book as well as one of his older books (Blink) he not only spent lots of time researching what he was writing about but even went to the locations of the events. Specifically, a murder that took place in *Blink* was of specific interest to him and he drove all the way to the steps of where this citizen was murdered. This is one of the reasons I like this author and you can see the passion that he puts into his writing from these actions.

Gladwell begins this book with the story of Sandra Bland and the events that led to her suicide after being pulled over for a small driving infraction (not using blinker when changing lanes). He brilliantly hooks the reader into the story of Sandra and the events that unfolded that day. Additionally, this leads into the first chapter of the book beginning with spies and their deceptions (or lack thereof).


## Chapter 1

The first chapter begins with the lies and deception used by Fidel Castro in the United States having spies within the DIA and CIA. He explains that we need to listen closely to what people are saying because we don't always know who to trust.

This chapter was short but absolutely sets up the rest of the book and introduces a later defined concept of the humans default to the truth.

## Chapter 2

The second chapter was especially interesting to me as I have a strong interest in the past. This chapter begins with the interactions between Neville Chamberlain and Hitler before the start of World War II. The title of this chapter is "Getting to Know FÃ¼hrer" and shows how Hitler used lies and deception to convince Chamberlain they were safe from a war. Gladwell explains how we use patterns and excuses to confirm our suspicions and what we want to hear from certain interactions. In this case, Hitler convinced Chamberlain that he would not invade and begin WWII. 

The second part of this chapter then aims to show the differences between human emotion and machine. Will artificial intelligence be able to better distinguish between the people who lie and those who are telling the truth? How would these algorithms be able to navigate around systematic bias and racism within the court room? These are the questions that begin to be answered (Alternatively, these questions are also answered in another book "System Error"). Aritifical intelligence tends to be better than humans in most cases as we try to judge others like we know them, rather than complete strangers (Chamberlains greatest downfall - trust).

## Chapter 3

**The Default to Truth** - This is a large concept which is defined in this chapter and shows up a lot within the rest of the book and earlier. The default to truth works like the phrase "Innocent until proven guilty". We as humans don't listen to conversations from an unbiased standpoint, we believe until we have a reason not to.

This story comes back to Fidel Castro and one of the *greatest* spies in the DIA, Ana Montes. Montes was at the top of her game and fooling the CIA and DIA for years, being a honored spy for Cuba in the US. Later it was found out how much she decieved the United States while being terrible at telling lies. She was able to get away for so long for the simple default to truth. How could one of the top people in the DIA who always does her job right be a spy for Cuba?...

Gladwell explains that no matter how close you are to someone or how great they may appear, you can be completely blind to their true intentions. We don't only believe what this person has to say but we rationalize it to fit our own perception of reality or what we want reality to be.

## Chapter 4
